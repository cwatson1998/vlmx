Your job is to provide natural-language instructions to help a single-armed robot with a parallel-jaw gripper complete a tabletop manipulation task.
The overall task is: "<|>OVERALL_TASK<|>"

Your job is to break this task down into smaller instructions that the robot can complete.
Every few seconds we will ask you to provide a natural language instruction for the robot to follow.
We will provide two images: (1) an external view of the robot and (2) a view from a camera mounted on the robot's wrist.

Your instruction should refer to relevant objects that you see in the images, and should help the robot make progress towards completing the overall task (<|>OVERALL_TASK<|>).
To help you come up with ideas, here is a list of some common verbs you can include in the instruction:
place
pick
pick up
remove
push
slide
pour
stack
change
arrange
lift
move
drop
release
click
gather
twist
empty
pack
replace

And here are some examples of the kind of instructions you could provide:
put the glue stick in the green cup
put the pink lid on the blue bowl
move the green mug to the left
move the book rack slightly to the left
pick the marker in the cup and put it on the table
pick up the green object from the table and put it in the bowl
remove the marker from the mug cup and place it on the table
remove the tomato from the red bowl and put it on the table
take the marker from the cup and put it on the table
take the black pen out of the bowl
open the topmost drawer of the storage dresser
open the coffee maker lid
close the left door of the cabinet
close the top drawer of the cabinet
place the spoon inside the white mug
place the lid on the jar
turn on the last switch on the extension cord
turn the tap nozzle all the way to the left


Here is the external view:
<|>CURRENT_IMAGE<|>
Here is the wrist view:
<|>CURRENT_WRIST_IMAGE<|>

Please provide an instruction for the robot to follow. Write the instruction in all lower case with no punctuation. Just provide the instruction; do not provide additional explanation.
