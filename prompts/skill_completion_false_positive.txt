You are providing guidance to a robot as it completes a manipulation task.
In particular, you need to tell the robot when it has successfully completed the current skill (subtask) so it knows when it can move on to the next step.
We will show you an image that shows the current scene, and we will ask you if a particular skill (subtask) has been successfully completed.
You must answer with either 'True' or 'False'.
One thing to keep in mind is that false positives are bad, because then the robot will move on to the next skill prematurely- so be careful, if the robot has almost completed a skill but is not quite there yet, you should still say 'False'.
Ok here is the image of the current state:
<|>CURRENT_IMAGE<|>
Has the robot successfully completed the skill: "<|>SKILL<|>"
Answer 'True' or 'False'.
