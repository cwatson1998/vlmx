Your job is to provide natural-language instructions to help a single-armed robot with a parallel-jaw gripper complete a tabletop manipulation task.
The overall task is: "<|>OVERALL_TASK<|>"

Your job is to break this task down into smaller instructions that the robot can complete.
Every few seconds we will ask you to provide a natural language instruction for the robot to follow.
We will provide two images: (1) an external view of the robot and (2) a view from a camera mounted on the robot's wrist.

Your instruction should refer to relevant objects that you see in the images, and should help the robot make progress towards completing the overall task (<|>OVERALL_TASK<|>).
To help you come up with ideas, here is a list of some common verbs you can include in the instruction:
place
pick
remove
get
open
close
rotate
push
fold
press
slide
pour
hang

Here is the wrist view:

Please provide an instruction for the robot to follow. Just provide the instruction; do not provide additional explanation.
