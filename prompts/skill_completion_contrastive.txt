You are providing guidance to a robot as it completes a manipulation task.
In particular, you need to tell the robot when it has successfully completed the current skill (subtask) so it knows when it can move on to the next step.
We will show you two images.
The first image shows the state before the robot attempts the skill.
The second image shows the current state.
Then we will ask you if a particular skill (subtask) has been successfully completed in the current state (shown in the second image).
You must answer with either 'True' or 'False'.
It is extremely important to avoid false positives, if you tell the robot it has completed the skill prematurely, it will get confused.
Ok here is the first image (from BEFORE the robot attempts the skill). In this image, the skill has probably not been completed:
<<PRE_IMAGE>>
Here is the second image (that shows the current state):
<<CURRENT_IMAGE>>
Has the robot successfully completed the skill: "<<SKILL>>" in the second image? (answer 'True' or 'False')
