You are providing guidance to a robot as it completes a manipulation task.
In particular, you need to tell the robot when it has successfully completed the current skill (subtask) so it knows when it can move on to the next step.
We will show you an image that shows the current scene, and we will ask you if a particular skill (subtask) has been successfully completed.
You must answer with either 'True' or 'False'.
We will first give you a text description of what the scene looked like BEFORE the robot started doing anything.

Original Description: 
<|>SCENE_DESCRIPTION<|>

A lot may have changed since this description was written, so you should primarily use it as a reference to help understand the names of the objects in the scene.
Understand that the objects might be called slightly different things in the skill description, but the scene description should serve as a guide.
Ok here is the image of the current state:
<|>CURRENT_IMAGE<|>
Has the robot successfully completed the skill: "<|>SKILL<|>" ?
Answer 'True' or 'False'.
